## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository!

I'm a web developer passionate about building fast, efficient, and user-friendly web experiences. My work centers on performance optimization techniques, with a particular interest in lazy loading, efficient asset delivery, and fine-tuning both frontend and backend systems to reduce load times and enhance responsiveness.

This repository is a reflection of the ongoing effort to push the boundaries of what modern web applications can achieve in terms of speed and usability. Whether it's trimming down bundle sizes, deferring non-critical resources, or implementing dynamic imports, my goal is always to build applications that load quickly, run smoothly, and offer a seamless experience across devices and network conditions.

Performance is not just a featureâ€”it's a core part of the user experience. Thatâ€™s why I place a strong emphasis on metrics like Time to Interactive (TTI), First Contentful Paint (FCP), and Core Web Vitals in every project. I also explore strategies like image optimization, code splitting, caching strategies, and service workers to build performant, scalable web apps.

Many of the projects here are experimental or evolving, created as part of my learning process and passion for mastering performance techniques. I believe in continuous improvement and enjoy diving deep into performance bottlenecks, running audits, and measuring the real-world impact of each tweak.

Feel free to browse around, fork, or contribute. Iâ€™m always open to ideas, improvements, and collaboration with others who care about building a better, faster web.

Thanks for visitingâ€”hope you find something useful or inspiring here!
